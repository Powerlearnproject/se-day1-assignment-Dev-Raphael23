#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
   Software engineering is a systematic approach to applying engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.
   Some of its importance includes; enabling the creation of softwares in different aspects of life | It shapes our digital world enabling businesses to thrive   

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
   The term "Software Engineering" was formally introduced during a conference held at NATO in Garmisch, Germany, in 1968. This event aimed to address the growing crisis in software 
   development, as projects were consistently late, over budget, and failed to meet specifications.
2. Development of Structured Programming (1970s)
   In the 1970s, the structured programming paradigm emerged, emphasizing the use of clear structures in programming, such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines. Notable figures like 
   Edsger Dijkstra advocated for these principles, which aimed to improve the clarity and quality of code. The introduction of structured programming techniques represented a significant 
   advancement in reducing complexity and enabling better maintenance of software systems.
3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001)
   The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, marked a pivotal shift in software engineering paradigms. It emphasized collaboration, flexibility, and iterative development over rigid 
   planning and documentation. Agile methodologies, including Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), have since become widely adopted practices, enabling teams to respond more effectively to 
   changing requirements and delivering value to customers more rapidly.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   The Phases of SDLC include: Planning, requirements, design and prototype, software development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
   Planning: This initial phase involves defining the scope, objectives, and feasibility of the project. Stakeholders outline the requirements and outline a project plan, including 
   resources and timeframes.
   Requirements Analysis: In this phase, detailed functional and non-functional requirements are gathered from stakeholders. This helps in understanding what the software needs to 
   accomplish.
   Design: The design phase involves creating system architecture and detailed design specifications. It outlines how the software will meet the specified requirements, including user 
   interfaces, database structures, and system interfaces.
   Implementation (Coding): During this phase, developers translate design specifications into actual code using programming languages and development tools. This is where the application 
   is built.
   Testing: Once the software has been implemented, it undergoes rigorous testing to identify and eliminate defects. This phase can include unit testing, integration testing, system 
   testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
   Deployment: After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment. This may involve installation procedures and configuration for end users.
   Maintenance: Post-deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This involves performing regular updates, bug fixes, and enhancements based on user feedback and changing 
   requirements.
   Review and Feedback: It is also important for teams to review the project post-deployment to gather lessons learned and feedback, which can improve processes for future projects.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   Waterfall is a better method when a project must meet strict regulations as it requires deliverables for each phase before proceeding to the next one. Alternatively, Agile is better 
   suited for teams that plan on moving fast, experimenting with direction and don't know how the final project will look before they start.
   Waterfall methods can be used In a government project to build a new bridge, requiring thorough documentation, a clear set of specifications, compliance with safety standards, and 
   predictable timelines.
   Agile on the other hand can be used when developing a new social media application where user needs and trends may shift frequently, allowing for quick adjustments and new feature 
   integrations based on user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   **Software Developer (Roles and Responsibilities)**
   Design and Development: Write, test, and maintain the software code according to project specifications and requirements.
   Collaboration: Work closely with other developers, designers, and stakeholders to understand project functionality and requirements.
   Debugging and Troubleshooting: Identify and fix bugs in existing software applications to ensure robust performance.
   Code Review: Participate in code reviews to ensure code quality and share knowledge within the team.
   Documentation: Create and maintain technical documentation for software design, APIs, and user manuals.

  **Quality Assurance Engineer (Roles and Responsibilities)**
   Testing: Develop and execute test plans, test cases, and test scripts to ensure that software meets quality standards.
   Automation: Implement automated testing as necessary to increase efficiency and coverage.
   Defect Tracking: Identify, document, and track defects, and work with developers to ensure resolution.
   User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Coordinate with product stakeholders to conduct UAT and gather feedback.
   Continuous Improvement: Suggest process improvements and contribute to team learning regarding best practices in QA.

   **Project Manager (Roles and Responsibilities)**
   Project Planning: Define project scope, goals, and deliverables in collaboration with stakeholders and the team.
   Resource Management: Allocate resources and assign tasks to team members based on skills and project needs.
   Communication: Serve as the primary point of contact between the project team and external stakeholders, providing updates and addressing concerns.
   Risk Management: Identify potential risks to project success and develop mitigation strategies.
   Monitoring and Reporting: Track project progress, budgets, and timelines; report on performance metrics and project outcomes.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  **Importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**
  Efficiency: IDEs provide a comprehensive environment where developers can write, debug, and test their code without having to switch between different tools. This streamlines the 
  development process.
  Code Assistance: Features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and error detection help developers write code more quickly and with fewer bugs.
  Debugging Tools: IDEs typically come with integrated debugging tools that allow developers to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables, making it easier to 
  troubleshoot issues.
  Project Management: IDEs often include project management features that help organize files and resources, making it easier to manage complex projects.
  Examples of IDEs are; Visual Studio, Eclipse, PyCharm.

  Importance of Version Control Systems (VCS)
  Collaboration: VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes, facilitating teamwork.
  History Tracking: VCS maintains a history of changes, allowing developers to see who made what changes and when, which is essential for code reviews and audits.
  Branching and Merging: Developers can create branches to work on new features or fixes independently. Merging these branches back into the main codebase is streamlined, allowing for 
  parallel development.
  Backup and Recovery: VCS acts as a backup system; if something goes wrong, developers can easily revert to a previous version of the project.
  Examples of VCS are; Git, Subversion (SVN).

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  1. Unit Testing involves testing individual components or functions of the software for correctness, independently from the rest of the application.
     Importance:
     Helps in verifying that each unit of the software performs as expected.
     Facilitates easier identification and fixing of bugs early in the development process.
     Encourages a modular approach to coding, leading to more maintainable code.
  2. Integration Testing focuses on the interactions between integrated units/components to ensure they work together as intended.
     Importance:
     Identifies issues that may occur when different modules function together, which may not be apparent during unit testing.
     Ensures that the combined parts of an application operate correctly and data flow between them is valid.
  3. System Testing evaluates the entire application as a whole to ensure that it meets the specified requirements.
     Importance:
     Tests the full system's functionality and performance.
     Validates the softwareâ€™s compliance with the specified functional and non-functional requirements.
     Helps discover defects that arise due to interactions between different components and the overall system environment.
  4. Acceptance Testing is conducted to determine whether the software is ready for delivery based on the acceptance criteria defined by stakeholders or end-users.
     Importance:
     Ensures the product is usable and satisfactory for end-users.
     Validates that the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.
     Involves the actual users to confirm the functionality supports their needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
   Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing the input prompts given to AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4. It involves crafting 
   the text that you provide to the model to produce the most relevant, accurate, and useful outputs. It is like creating a special recipe for your robot. Just like a 
   recipe tells you exactly what ingredients to use and how to mix them to bake a delicious cake, a prompt tells the robot exactly what information you need and how you want it presented.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  An example of a Vague Prompt is : **"Tell me about cars."**
  Improved Prompt:
  **"List the top five electric car models available in 2023, including their range, price, and key features."**
  Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
  Clarity: The improved prompt clearly specifies what information is being sought (top five electric car models).
  Specificity: It narrows down the topic to a particular category (electric cars) and a specific time frame (available in 2023).
  Conciseness: It gets straight to the point without unnecessary details, making it easier to understand what is required.
  Actionable: The request for specific details (range, price, key features) tells the responder exactly what information to include.
